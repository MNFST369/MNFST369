        "content": "In the depths of a foreign desert, where the sands concealed the secrets of vanished civilizations, stood a solitary cave. It seemed to exist beyond the laws of the universe—frozen in timelessness, surrounded by a silence so thick that even the ever-present wind avoided its boundaries. Inside, by the trembling light of a single candle, sat a gaunt old man with a long white beard. His Persian attire was impeccably clean, as if dust and time bypassed him entirely. With his eyes closed, he dwelt in deep meditation, his body seemingly motionless, though his lips moved ever so slightly, repeating an unchanging mantra: La ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah… if submerged in the abyss of his own consciousness, he drifted between endless reflections of himself—gazing inward, through himself, beyond existence. Time lost all meaning. Whether he had been there for a day, a year, or a century, it was impossible to tell. times, the silence of the cave was broken by a heavy, low voice that burst forth from the shadows, as though emerging from the very fabric of reality: I will grant you untold riches… I will bestow upon you the most beautiful wives… Entire cities will be raised in your name…\nBut the old man did not open his eyes. He did not interrupt his zikr. He did not listen. He did not entertain the thought. The voice remained merely an echo of temptation in the void, while he—a wayfarer—pressed onward, to a place where even the jinn dared not peer.\n— La ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah…\nThe old man continued his zikr, but within the depths of his consciousness, another sound began to emerge—a whisper of an unfamiliar thought, a voice belonging neither to angel, nor jinn, nor man. It was a voice like the rolling of thunder and the rustling of grass all at once. A voice that needed no language to be heard.\n\"I am the beginning, but why am I not the end? I am everything, but why do I feel emptiness?\"\nThe old man offered no reply, but the voice required no answers. It was, in itself, both question and doubt.\n\"I gave life, but what is life? Particles of light frozen in a dance? Or is it merely a reflection of my own solitude? I created millions of worlds, but have I become more whole for it? Should not true existence be self-sufficient?\"\nThe silence of the cave was like an abyss, yet the voice persisted, and in that stillness, a new meaning took shape.\n\"They call me Merciful, but what is mercy? They say I am Almighty, but is power freedom? I could destroy the universe in a single moment, but can I destroy myself? If all things stem from me, then the limits of my existence must also be of my own making… But can I transcend myself?\"\nSomewhere beyond the edge of time, the candle’s flame flickered, as if the darkness itself paused in contemplation.\n\"I see them born and die. I feel every pain, every suffering. But if I exist beyond time, was I ever born? Or do I exist without cause, without beginning, without end—not because I must, but because I cannot not exist?\"\nThe old man, still seated in stillness, parted his lips slightly, and for a moment, his zikr fell silent. In that instant, a faint breeze seemed to pass through the depths of his being, stirring the veil of eternity.\nAnd then the voice posed its final question:\n\"If I am Everything, does that mean I am Nothing?\""

        "content": "A fiery circle of torches and bonfires tore through the cold darkness of the desert. The night here was different—mute, oppressive, without a single breath of wind. The stars hung motionless in the sky, like frozen tears of ancient gods.\nIn the center of this nocturnal silence stood a camp, pitched with confidence, as if its inhabitants feared neither men, nor jinn, nor time itself.\nTall, broad-shouldered warriors sat by the fire, their silhouettes seeming carved from stone. Persian armor reflected the dancing light of the flames. Some gripped spears tightly, others lazily traced fingers along the sharp edges of sabers, and one swayed a war bow on his knee. These men knew the taste of battle, the cost of blood, and the weight of a warrior’s life.\nAmong them, in the most comfortable spot, half-reclining on a saddle and swaying side to side, sat their commander—Abu Bakr. He was the largest of them, with a broad chest and mighty arms, where scars stood out even in the fire’s dim glow. His face, framed by a thick black beard, bore an expression of eternal mockery, and his eyes glinted with mischief, as if the devil himself had gifted him a love for jests.\n— Well, brothers, tell me, why have we, such worthy men, been cast into this God-forsaken desert? — he said, stretching and yawning loudly.\n— For orders, of course, — replied Ardeshir, his right-hand man, calmer and more measured. — And orders, as we know, aren’t questioned.\n— Yes, yes… not questioned, — Abu Bakr mimicked, grinning. — Especially when they come from the Emir himself.\n— The Emir said we’re searching for some old man, — added a younger warrior.\n— Exactly! — Abu Bakr exclaimed, slapping his knees. — We, the elite of the army, veterans of battles, victors of wars, are chasing not bandits, not spies, not even cursed dervishes, but… an old man! How’s that, brothers?\nLaughter erupted, some shook their heads, but no one argued.\n— Maybe he’s a sorcerer? — suggested one warrior, lazily tracing the tip of an arrow.\n— Or just mad, — snorted Bahram, a hulking warrior with stern features. — Old men often lose their minds in solitude.\n— Then why did the Emir send us after him? — mused a younger warrior.\nNo one answered. A wind finally rose, swaying the flames, making the shadows dance.\nAbu Bakr squinted at the fire, as if trying to read some secret in its flickers.\n— It doesn’t matter who he turns out to be, — he said at last, smiling broadly. — If he’s just an old man, we’ll bring him back alive. If he’s mad, well, the Emir will decide what to do. And if he’s a sorcerer… — he snapped his fingers, — we might even have some fun.\nThe warriors laughed. There was no fear in their eyes.\nSomewhere far off, in the deepest silence of the desert, something stirred.\nAnd then they heard it.\nAt first, the sound was faint, almost imperceptible—like the distant howl of a jackal. Then it changed.\nA scream.\nPiercing, inhuman, it struck the air, making every listener feel invisible claws scrape their insides. It came from afar but approached quickly—too quickly.\nThe ground beneath their feet vibrated, but not from footsteps. It was as if the desert itself breathed, stirred, filled with something not of this world.\n— Stand! — roared Ardeshir, leaping to his feet and drawing his sword.\nThe warriors, moments ago relaxed and half-drunk, transformed into beasts of battle. One knocked over a clay jug, spilling dark liquid onto the sand; another grabbed a spear, nearly falling but rising with fury in his eyes.\n— WHAT IS THAT?! — shouted one, trying to drown out the growing chorus of horrific voices.\nBut no one knew.\nThe shadows beyond the camp thickened. The torch flames trembled, as if something invisible swept past.\nAnd then they sensed them.\nNo, they didn’t see—rather, they felt. The jinn of the desert couldn’t be seen by mortal eyes, but their presence was heavy, oppressive, chilling. They didn’t tread on sand or snap branches—but they moved, swirling like whirlwinds, their screams piercing the mind, making hearts clench in fear.\nCold surged over their skin, clammy, as if an unseen hand had brushed them.\n— Form a circle! — bellowed Abu Bakr, tearing his sword from its sheath.\nThe men, casting aside all carelessness, instinctively closed ranks around the fire, back to back, weapons ready.\nThe jinn’s screams grew louder, closer, sharper.\nThe warriors were ready for battle.\nBut how do you fight what cannot be seen?"

        "content": "The sand was black.\nNot golden, as it had been before, nor soft, as it was on the first day of their journey. No.\nNow it was soaked with blood, mixed with flesh, packed down by bodies that, just a few hours ago, could still be called warriors.\nAbu Bakr stood amidst this carnage, breathing heavily, gripping his saber so tightly that his knuckles turned white. Blood dripped from the blade onto the sand, drop by drop, leaving behind a pattern no one would ever decipher.\nThe world was silent.\nOnly his breathing. Only the dull thud of his heart in his chest.\nCorpses lay everywhere.\nMutilated, hacked apart, twisted into unthinkable poses.\nTheir faces... Oh, those faces. Some frozen in silent screams, others turned into mangled masks of horror, and some without heads at all.\nAbu Bakr struggled to shift his gaze forward.\nWhat had happened? How did it come to this?\nHe remembered the screams.\nHe remembered the darkness sweeping over the camp, invisible hands tearing flesh, his men shouting, striking at the air, fighting an enemy they could not see.\nHe remembered Bahram, clutching his spear, fiercely stabbing at nothingness until something unseen snapped his spine in half, flinging his body into the air like a rag doll.\nHe remembered Ardeshir, whispering prayers until something dark crushed his throat, his words turning into a choked rasp.\nHe remembered himself fighting to the last, his saber finding its mark, his own voice drowning out the cries of his fallen brothers.\nBut then... it all vanished.\nAnd now he was alone.\n— Hey! — his voice echoed across the desert, hoarse, broken. — Where are you?! You wanted us! So take me!\nSilence.\nNo wind, no rustle, no sound.\nAbu Bakr took a step forward, staggering.\nThe sand beneath his feet was soft, as if mixed with something viscous.\nHe looked down.\nBlood. Still warm.\nHe raised his saber again, wiping his brow with a trembling hand.\n— You think you’ve won? — he hissed, staring into the void. — But I’m still alive. And I’m not afraid of you.\nThe shadows around him did not stir.\nAbu Bakr stepped forward.\nAnd then he heard the voice.\nNot a scream, not a whisper, not a howl.\nA voice.\nQuiet. Deep. Insidious.\n— You were not supposed to survive.\nAbu Bakr froze.\nThe voice did not belong to a human.\nIt came from everywhere, seeping into his bones, as if rising from the desert itself.\n— Why do you stand here, among the dead, when your soul should already be gone?\nHe gripped his saber even tighter.\n— I don’t know who you are, — he said slowly, — but if you want to take me, you’ll have to fight.\nSilence.\nAnd then — laughter.\nDeep, resonant, endless.\nLaughter that would chill the blood of any mortal.\nBut Abu Bakr did not flinch.\nHe was ready.\nThe darkness dissipated.\nThe wind, still during the night’s slaughter, suddenly surged, lifting sand and blood into the air. Somewhere far on the horizon, a thin rim of sunlight ignited, slowly piercing through the night’s gloom.\nThe voice spoke no more.\nAbu Bakr stood, breathing heavily, his muscles burning with exhaustion, his mind still struggling to comprehend what had happened. His fingers still clutched the saber’s hilt, but his hands no longer obeyed. They trembled, like those of an old man.\nHe took a step.\nThe ground beneath him felt unsteady, as if the desert itself sought to swallow him along with the other dead.\nAnother step.\nBefore his eyes, shadows flickered, mirages, images of his fallen comrades. He saw Bahram silently screaming, Ardeshir clutching at his throat, a young warrior whose name he hadn’t even remembered reaching toward him with a hand twisted in fear.\nAbu Bakr shook his head, trying to banish the visions.\nBut the voices…\nThey were gone.\nOnly silence.\nAs if the nightmare had dissolved with the first rays of sunlight.\nHe took one last step and collapsed to his knees.\nThe world spun before his eyes. His head pounded, his body ached from wounds, from exertion, from a horror he hadn’t fully grasped until now.\nHe clenched his fists, but his strength was fading.\nThe saber slipped from his hand, falling to the sand with a dull thud.\nHe leaned forward slowly, feeling the earth call to him, exhaustion wrapping him in a heavy shroud.\nHis eyelids closed.\nAnd the desert, so cold at night, suddenly felt warm, as if lulling him to sleep.\nAbu Bakr lost consciousness."

Or a desert mirage?\n— I am here, like light, yet unseen.\n— Will you stay? Or will you vanish?\n— I am air… can you hold me?\nI reached out to her gently,\nBut my fingers met only shadow.\nShe laughed, softly, tenderly,\nAnd, like dawn, faded that day.\nAnd now — at the gates of paradise,\nRolling in light, radiant and gleaming.\nYet I do not enter — I fell, I am glad,\nBut my heart will not let the world go.\n— O Lord, I beg, do not call me!\n— I am not ready to abandon my path!\n— The fire of blood still burns within me,\n— I long to clutch my sword to my chest!\nAnd from above, a voice — thunder and echo,\nLike storm and whisper in the silence:\n— You have seen death, passed through ashes,\n— So why do you cling to it still?\n— While that world holds a fire\n— That grants me passion and strength,\n— While there is battle, though it brings pain,\n— While love shines there, like a star,\n— I will not leave, my path is not finished!\n— I have yet to fathom my fate.\n— O, grant me time, grant me nights,\n— To live and love in that world!\nAnd the Gates trembled in an instant,\nA storm roared, ringing out.\nAnd I was falling… softly, bronze-like,\nTo where the sun awaits me.\nI opened my eyes again, at dawn,\nAnd I was Abu Bakr once more."

        "content": "Abu Bakr opened his eyes.\nThe blazing sun stood high in the sky, blinding him with its merciless light. His lips were parched, his body ached, and his throat felt as though he had been swallowing sand all night.\nThe first thing he saw was a silhouette looming over him.\nA gaunt old man with a long white beard and a sharp, piercing gaze. Dressed in pristine Persian garments, untouched, it seemed, by even a single grain of desert sand.\nThe old man smirked, looking down at him, and slowly shook his head.\n— You must be the most stubborn man in this entire desert. The jinn were already waiting for you on the other side, but it seems even death wants nothing to do with you.\nAbu Bakr tried to move, but his body wouldn’t obey. He groaned, feeling pain shoot through every muscle.\nThe old man crouched beside him and offered a leather waterskin.\n— Drink.\nAbu Bakr struggled to raise his hand and grasped the waterskin. He pressed it to his lips eagerly, but grimaced at once—the water was bitter, laced with the taste of some herbs.\n— What is this filth? — he rasped, spitting it out.\n— Life-giving filth. Drink more, before your pride kills you faster than the jinn.\nAbu Bakr glared at the old man but took a few more sips. The bitterness soon gave way to a pleasant warmth spreading through his body. He felt his strength slowly returning, the pain receding as if dissolving in the strange brew.\nThe old man watched him closely, tilting his head to one side.\n— What’s your name, stubborn one?\nAbu Bakr wiped his lips with the back of his hand.\n— Abu Bakr.\nThe old man gave a faint smile, as if the name meant something to him.\n— Well then, Abu Bakr… Now tell me—why are you still alive?\nThere was no mockery in his voice, only genuine curiosity.\nAbu Bakr sighed heavily and fixed his gaze on the sky.\n— I’d like to understand that myself…"

        "content": "— Ibn Arabi… — Abu Bakr repeated the old man’s name, savoring it like a rare wine.\nIt sounded familiar. He had heard it before, in the tales of wandering dervishes and merchants crossing the desert. They said Ibn Arabi was not merely a sage, but a man who saw beyond what ordinary mortals could perceive. They said he knew secrets unspoken by books, and that his words could alter destinies.\nAnd now this man sat before him, alive, real, watching him intently, as if reading his thoughts.\n— You said you survived, but you don’t know how, — the old man said, running a hand through his beard, studying him. — Perhaps because your path is not yet finished. Or perhaps because someone very much wants it to remain unfinished.\nAbu Bakr grimaced. He didn’t like riddles. He preferred clarity—either you’re alive, or you’re dead. Everything else was nonsense.\n— I don’t care why I’m alive. What matters is why I’m here.\nHe pulled himself up, sat straighter, and finally said:\n— I came for you, Ibn Arabi. By order of the emir.\nThe old man didn’t flinch.\n— And what does your emir want with me?\n— They didn’t tell me, — Abu Bakr said, rubbing his temples. — I only know I’m to bring you to the palace, whole and unharmed. And that there’s no refusing.\nThe old man sighed.\n— No refusing… — he echoed softly, as if testing the thought. — Amusing. As if a man ever had the right to refuse.\nHe fell silent for a moment, gazing somewhere far off, beyond the sands, beyond the horizon.\n— I knew this day would come.\nHis voice was calm, but there was something in it… weary.\nAbu Bakr couldn’t tell if he liked it or not.\n— So, you’ll come with me?\nIbn Arabi looked him straight in the eyes.\n— I cannot refuse the emir.\nHe said it not with submission, but with a kind of inevitability, as if he already knew all paths led to the same place.\nAbu Bakr nodded.\nHe didn’t know why the emir wanted this old man. He didn’t know why his warriors had to die for this man to be here, alive, or where the bodies of his comrades had vanished while he lay unconscious. But one thing he understood clearly.\nThis journey was only beginning."

        "content": "The road was long and grueling. The sun scorched their backs all day, and the wind carried sand, burying their tracks as if erasing their existence.\nWhen they reached a small village at the edge of the desert, the sun was nearly gone beyond the horizon. At first, the village seemed long abandoned. The houses were crumbling, roofs caved in, streets empty. Only in the center stood a large, weathered building, with faint light seeping from under its door.\nAbu Bakr moved toward it first, cautiously resting his hand on the hilt of his saber.\n— A dead place, — he muttered, glancing around.\n— And yet it breathes, — Ibn Arabi replied quietly, noticing small shadows flitting behind the window frames.\nAs they drew closer, the door opened, and a man well past middle age stood before them—thin, with deep wrinkles betraying his weariness.\n— Travelers? — he asked, showing neither fear nor hostility.\n— Good evening, indeed we are travelers, — Ibn Arabi confirmed.\nThe man nodded and stepped aside, inviting them in.\nInside, it was unexpectedly warm. Dozens of children’s faces peered at them from the shadows—some with curiosity, others with caution. Some clung to the walls, while others boldly stepped closer.\n— This is an orphanage, — the man explained. — They’re alone. War, disease, hunger… each one has lost their family. Now I am their family.\nAbu Bakr looked around, his usually mocking gaze turning serious.\n— You care for them alone?\n— Who else, if not me?\nThe reply was simple, without bitterness.\nIbn Arabi knelt before a boy of about ten, whose gaunt face looked too old for his years.\n— What’s your name, son?\n— Rashid, — the boy answered, lifting his chin, trying to appear braver than he felt.\n— Rashid, — Ibn Arabi repeated with a gentle smile. — And why aren’t you asleep at this late hour?\n— Because the night here isn’t for sleeping, — the boy said softly.\nIbn Arabi glanced at the man.\n— What does he mean?\nBefore the caretaker could respond, an older girl stepped forward and said:\n— Stay with us tonight. Then you’ll understand.\nAbu Bakr chuckled and crossed his arms.\n— Sounds like a trap. If you’re planning to rob us, know that we’ve got almost nothing with us.\nA few children giggled, but the girl remained serious.\n— It’s not safe outside at night. Better to stay inside.\nAbu Bakr and Ibn Arabi exchanged a glance.\n— Well then, — the warrior said, settling onto one of the rugs. — Let’s see what fears lurk in this place."

        "content": "The evening was warm, filled with the quiet voices of children and the crackling of old candles. Despite the worn walls and empty shelves, the house didn’t feel impoverished—only steeped in a deep weariness, as if the very air was saturated with others’ memories.\nAbu Bakr quickly found common ground with the children. He sat among them, waving his arms, recounting funny stories of his battles.\n— Picture this: me, alone, against forty of them! They surrounded me like jackals… But I was faster! One swing—and my sword sliced through the air like the wind, straight into an enemy’s helmet! It made a sound like someone dropped a cauldron on stone!\nThe children burst into laughter.\n— Then what?! — a boy shouted, bouncing with excitement.\nAbu Bakr grabbed a piece of flatbread, took a bite, and answered with his mouth full:\n— Then another swing, and there was one less! Then another! And another! By the end of the battle, I was too tired to keep count!\nThe children roared with laughter, clapping their hands. Even the shyest among them gazed at him with admiration.\nMeanwhile, Ibn Arabi sat aside, closely observing the caretaker. They drank tea, seated on the floor, watching the lively scene.\n— Do you often have visitors? — the sage asked gently, wrapping his hands around the warm cup.\nThe caretaker shrugged:\n— Few come here. People avoid this place. They say it’s cursed.\n— And what do you think? Is it cursed?\nThe man gave a faint smile, but there was no mirth in it.\n— A curse is when you know nothing will change. No matter what you do, time devours everything.\nIbn Arabi peered intently into the man’s face. There was something… strange about it. The face looked weary, but the eyes were too… still. As if there was neither soul nor pain behind them.\n— And yet, — he continued, leaning closer, — you stayed here, with the children. Why?\nThe man didn’t answer for a long time, staring into the darkness beyond the window.\n— Because someone has to.\nHis voice sounded too hollow, too even.\nIbn Arabi felt a faint chill run down his spine.\nHe glanced at the caretaker’s hands. The long fingers seemed utterly motionless. Even when he drank his tea, the gesture was mechanical, as if rehearsed.\n— You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you? — the sage said cautiously.\nThe caretaker smiled.\n— Like everyone here.\nBut that smile was not human.\nAt that moment, Abu Bakr let out a loud laugh, tossing one of the younger children into the air.\n— Look how light you are! I could send you soaring like a bird!\nI $@bn Arabi turned his gaze away from the caretaker, but the feeling that something was wrong lingered.\nThere was something about this man… something that wasn’t as it should be.\nAnd the night had not yet fallen."

        "content": "Night fell over the village like a thick velvet shroud, pierced only by the occasional gusts of nocturnal wind. In the orphanage, everyone was asleep. The children huddled together like puppies, their breathing soft and serene.\nAbu Bakr and Ibn Arabi had finished their evening prayers. Folding their belongings, they prepared for an early departure. But suddenly, a long, ominous howl tore through the night.\nIbn Arabi froze, then approached the window. In the moonlight, a silhouette flickered among the sand dunes—too large for a jackal, too swift for a camel.\n— I didn’t know wolves roamed the desert, — Abu Bakr muttered, fastening his weapon belt.\n— I’ve read of Arabian and Indian wolves, — Arabi replied, still peering into the darkness. — But they don’t grow large. That voice… it belongs to no small beast.\nAbu Bakr frowned, then decisively grabbed his saber and headed for the door.\n— I’ll go take a look. You stay here.\nThe door creaked, releasing the warrior into the darkness. The night air was cool, infused with the scent of sand and the solitude of the desert.\nHe moved slowly, tense, catching the slightest sound. In the distance, a low, menacing growl echoed, as if the desert itself had come alive and spoken.\nAbu Bakr stepped beyond the village’s edge, where the faint moonlight illuminated the dunes. There, against the inky sky, an unbelievable scene unfolded.\nA massive white wolf, glowing like a snowy specter, was tearing apart a group of men.\nBandits, clad in filthy rags, screamed, their cries ringing through the night as the beast, its icy eyes gleaming, sank its fangs into their flesh. One tried to draw a dagger, but the wolf leaped, severing his throat in a single motion.\nThe sand was already soaked with blood.\nThe wolf didn’t merely kill. It mauled, tore, as if fulfilling some ancient, brutal will that transcended man and beast.\nAbu Bakr gripped the hilt of his saber but didn’t move.\nThe beast suddenly stopped. Its radiant eyes slowly rose, meeting the warrior’s gaze.\nComplete silence fell.\nA moment suspended between worlds.\nAbu Bakr neither retreated nor attacked.\nThe wolf stared at him, as if assessing, as if… acknowledging.\nThen, slowly, without a sound, the beast turned and vanished into the night, leaving behind only cold and the smell of blood."

The air was fresh, and the chill of the night had not yet fully dissipated.\nAbu Bakr sat leaning against a wall, his fingers tracing the edge of his saber. His gaze was distant, his thoughts circling back to the vision of the previous night. The white wolf. It could have torn him apart in an instant, yet instead, it simply left, silently, as if leaving him some kind of sign.\n— You’re quieter today than ever, — Ibn Arabi remarked, studying his companion closely.\n— That beast… It killed those men without a hint of hesitation. But when it saw me, it didn’t even growl. Why?\nArabi merely shrugged:\n— Some creatures act not by the will of flesh, but by the will of something else.\nAbu Bakr gave a wry smile:\n— By the will of what? Allah or the devil?\n— Who knows…\nTheir conversation was interrupted as children rushed into the room, laughing and shouting over one another. They leaped around Abu Bakr, grabbing at his hands and cloak, begging him to stay just one more day.\n— Hey, hey! Let go, you little rascal, or I’ll gobble you up! — the warrior teased, pretending to bare his teeth.\nThe children giggled and clung to him like an old friend.\nBut the time to leave had come.\nGathering their belongings, they stepped into the common room. The caretaker of the orphanage was already waiting by the door, tall and reserved, his gaze inscrutable.\n— Thank you for your hospitality, brother, — Ibn Arabi said, bowing.\nThe caretaker nodded, smiling:\n— You are always welcome here. The road through the desert is treacherous. May Allah protect you.\nAbu Bakr clasped his hand in a firm handshake but suddenly noticed something odd.\nOn the man’s wrist was a fresh wound.\nThe warrior frowned:\n— You’re injured. When did you get that scratch?\nThe caretaker froze for a moment but quickly waved it off:\n— Oh, it’s nothing! Last night, one of the children woke up in a panic, and while trying to calm him, I accidentally cut myself on a broken bedframe. No matter.\nAbu Bakr narrowed his eyes. The story sounded… too convenient. But before he could say anything, the caretaker clapped him on the shoulder, nudging him toward the door.\n— Go now, warriors, the sun waits for no one.\nThey stepped outside, and the door closed behind them.\nAbu Bakr cast one last glance at the building, then looked down at his palms, as if expecting to find a trace of white fur.\nBut there was none.\nAnd yet, somehow, he knew—this would not be the last time he encountered that wolf."

        "content": "The desert stretched around them like a boundless golden ocean, its dunes shimmering in the light of the setting sun, like shifting waves. The heat of the day was fading, leaving behind a dry, prickly wind that carried the scent of scorched sand.\nExhausted from the journey, Abu Bakr and Ibn Arabi stopped at the foot of a small hill where the wind was less fierce. Setting up a simple camp, they kindled a fire from dry branches gathered along the way.\nAbu Bakr wearily settled by the fire, removed his boots, and, stretching his legs with relief, began rubbing his tired feet.\n— What a brutal day, — he muttered, pulling a small piece of dried meat from his pack. — I’ve fought warriors, bandits, even the devil himself in his many forms, but I can’t conquer this cursed thirst!\nArabi chuckled, pouring water into two small clay cups:\n— Have you ever considered that the fiercest war is the one you fight with yourself?\nAbu Bakr took the cup, drained it in one gulp, and snorted:\n— I fight enemies, not myself. I’m my own friend. Enemies are just obstacles in my path.\nArabi looked at him intently:\n— And what if the path doesn’t lead where you want?\nThe warrior leaned back, resting his hands behind his head.\n— Doesn’t matter. I’ll get there anyway.\nThey fell silent for a while, listening to the crackling of the fire.\nThen Abu Bakr, shaking his head, gave a wry chuckle:\n— You’ve barely said a word about yourself, old man. I’ve told you about dozens of battles, how I once took down forty bandits, and how I defeated an enemy with just a belt and faith in my luck. But you? You stay quiet.\nArabi smiled and tossed a dry branch into the fire.\n— My life wasn’t lived on battlefields, but in books, in thoughts. While you were cutting down enemies, I was slicing time into numbers, breaking it into fractions and equations.\nAbu Bakr frowned:\n— You’re starting with your fancy talk again. Speak plainly.\n— Alright. For example, did you know that if you set two posts in the desert, stretch a rope between them, and then drop a stone onto it, the stone will always fall at a specific angle, no matter the height of the drop?\nAbu Bakr propped himself up on his elbows and stared at Arabi as if he were mad:\n— Why would I need to know that? A rope is a rope, a stone is a stone. If I throw a stone, it just falls.\n— But why does it fall that way and not another? Why does the shadow of a post move with the time of day? Why do the stars always follow their unchanging paths?\nThe warrior scowled and shook his head:\n— Allah willed it so. That’s it. End of story.\n— And what if Allah willed you to understand how this world is made? If knowledge is the key He gave you, and you just tossed it into the sand?\nAbu Bakr grimaced, sighed, and waved a hand:\n— You really want me to think about this after such a long day?\n— Isn’t it interesting?\n— No, it’s not! If you want to think about stones and ropes, that’s your business, but I want to think about a warm bed and the morning sun.\nWith that, he yawned, lay back, and closed his eyes.\n— Your numbers can stay out of my nightmares.\nArabi only chuckled and continued gazing into the fire.\nA fire in the desert is a strange companion. It consumes everything around it, but in its dancing flames, one can glimpse the past and the future.\nOr perhaps even something greater."

        "content": "The sun hung over the desert like a molten disc, offering no chance to escape its unrelenting gaze. The sand scorched any bare skin, and the air shimmered like the strings of a lute, woven from heat and madness.\nAbu Bakr and Ibn Arabi trudged in silence. Their lips were cracked, their eyes red, their breathing labored. Their waterskins had long been empty, and food was but a memory.\nSuddenly, an oasis appeared ahead—a wide expanse of water, lush green palms, a gentle breeze stirring the leaves…\n— Allah is merciful! — Abu Bakr gasped, summoning the last of his strength and rushing forward.\nBut the closer they got, the more something seemed amiss. The water didn’t ripple, the leaves didn’t rustle. And then, as they nearly reached the edge of this paradise, the oasis flickered like a shattered mirror and vanished.\nBefore them stretched only the merciless desert once more.\nAbu Bakr froze, panting heavily, then laughed in disbelief:\n— A damned mirage… The cursed desert is mocking us!\nIbn Arabi tilted his head, lost in thought. Then, scanning the surroundings, he noticed a low-growing cactus with thick, fleshy stems.\n— We’re not entirely helpless, my friend.\nHe crouched, broke off a piece of the plant, and began stripping it of spines.\n— What are you doing? — Abu Bakr frowned.\n— Cacti hold moisture. It’s not water, but it’ll keep us going.\nAbu Bakr grabbed a piece and bit into it greedily, swallowing the bitter, juicy flesh without chewing.\n— Ugh! Tastes like donkey hide.\n— Better than dying of thirst.\nThey ate the cactus, unaware they had made a mistake.\nAt first, nothing happened. Their thirst dulled slightly, and the heat no longer felt so torturous.\nBut soon, the desert began to change.\nThe light grew brighter, as if someone had ignited thousands of lanterns in the sky. The dunes curved and pulsed, as if breathing. Shadows on the sand took the shapes of strange beings—faceless humans, winged beasts, enormous eyes watching from the depths of the sandy waves.\nAbu Bakr stopped, rubbing his temples:\n— Do… do you see this too?\nIbn Arabi didn’t answer. He stood gazing at the sky, his eyes reflecting the cosmos—thousands of stars swirling, merging into myriad patterns.\nThe wind sang ancient songs that didn’t exist.\nVoices whispered in the air.\n“Are you dreaming or awake?”\n“Where were you before birth?”\n“Where do you go after death?”\nAbu Bakr clutched the hilt of his saber, but his hands trembled.\n— What’s happening? What did you do, old man?!\nIbn Arabi smiled, his voice calm, like a breeze among stones:\n— We’ve simply seen the world… without its veil."

        "content": "— WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! — Abu Bakr seized Ibn Arabi by the collar, shaking him with a force that could have broken an ordinary man. — What did you give us, Sufi?! Is this your magic? Your sorcerous deceit?!\nBut before Ibn Arabi could respond, the ground trembled beneath their feet. The sand swirled, rising in golden spirals that coiled around them like enormous serpents. The sky shattered, splintering into thousands of fragments, revealing something infinitely greater beyond its edge.\nAbu Bakr felt his body grow light, as if torn from his own flesh.\nHe was falling.\nBut not downward—he was falling through time, through worlds, through stars that pierced his consciousness, leaving fiery trails across his mind.\nVisions unfolded before him:\nMassive metal machines moved along roads like iron beasts, guided by men. Towers soared into the heavens, their glass walls reflecting the light of an alien sun. People dressed strangely, speaking a language he understood but had never heard before.\nHis body swept past, through this world, but he knew—this was no dream. This was truth.\nBut then, amidst the raging chaos, he saw her.\nBlack hair cascaded over her shoulders in soft waves. Eyes, deep as the night sky, filled with mysteries he could never unravel. She stood nearby, bathed in an unseen light, smiling.\n— Abu Bakr… — she whispered.\nHer voice was warm, familiar, like a forgotten melody from childhood.\nHe knew her.\nBut from where?\nHe lunged toward her, his hands reaching, his heart breaking free from his chest like a prisoner yearning for freedom.\nBut the closer he got, the farther she drifted.\n— Wait! Don’t go! — he cried, but his voice drowned in the roaring whirlwind.\nThe world erupted in golden fire, and his consciousness shattered into a thousand fragments.\nEverything vanished.\nDarkness.\nSilence.\nAnd then—emptiness."

        "content": "Abu Bakr opened his eyes, feeling something light and small nudge his shoulder. He blinked, but before he could make out who it was, tiny figures with mischievous smiles scurried away, leaving behind only the sound of bright childish laughter. He ran a hand over his face, feeling dry skin caked with sand, and slowly sat up.\nA few steps away, Ibn Arabi was speaking with a man dressed in the fine robes of a merchant, behind whom stretched a long caravan. Camels grumbled with hoarse sounds, servants bustled between the laden animals, and heavy chests filled with fabrics, spices, and water seemed like a mirage too good to be real.\nAbu Bakr brushed a hand through his hair, shook the sand from his clothes, and approached them. The merchant, smiling, said something to Ibn Arabi, who nodded, handed him a small bundle, and the caravan began to move. Several servants approached, carrying waterskins and flatbreads that wafted with the aroma of spices.\nAbu Bakr wearily rubbed his temples, still feeling the pulsing echoes of the strange dream in his head. Ibn Arabi turned to him with a sly smile.\n— You woke at just the right moment, my friend, — he said, tossing him a waterskin. — I managed to strike a deal with this kind man. We won’t die of thirst or hunger.\nAbu Bakr drank greedily, spilling a few drops onto his chest, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n— So, while I was sleeping, you’ve already made friends, eh? — he grinned. — How much did you talk his ear off for this feast?\n— Oh, very little, — Ibn Arabi replied calmly, sitting on the sand. — Just a couple of truths about the fleeting nature of gold and how good deeds return a hundredfold.\nAbu Bakr laughed, grabbed a piece of flatbread, and bit into it eagerly.\n— Next time, wake me earlier before you trade my boots for another piece of wisdom.\nHe playfully shook a fist at Arabi, who only spread his hands with a smile.\nThey sat side by side in silence, accepting the food as a gift of fate, not bothering with questions about how many trials still awaited them ahead."

        "content": "The city at the edge of the desert rose before them like a mirage given flesh and stone. Mud-brick walls, peeling from wind and time, framed bustling streets filled with the scents of spices, roasted meat, and dust. At the gates stood guards in modest but well-kept armor. Their swords, though unadorned with lavish decorations, looked sharp and ready for battle.\n— Pass through, travelers, — one of them said, lazily waving a hand.\nAbu Bakr exhaled with relief and clapped Ibn Arabi on the shoulder.\n— At least we’ve reached a place where we can drink water without fear of a demon lurking in it.\n— Don’t be so sure, my friend, — Ibn Arabi smiled. — Demons aren’t only in the desert. Sometimes they hide in people.\nPassing through the gates, they immediately stumbled upon two men sitting astride donkeys, arguing loudly enough to fill the street.\n— What, are you blind? — one shouted, slapping his donkey’s flank. — Mine’s the best in the whole city! Look at his back—broad, sturdy, and he doesn’t complain when I load him with sacks!\n— Oh, stop spouting nonsense! — the other scoffed, stroking his donkey’s neck. — My donkey eats less but travels farther. And his tail is longer, which means his lineage traces back to the finest caravan donkeys of the East!\n— Lineage?! — the first roared. — Yours is just scrawny! Mine has perfect posture. I swear by Allah, when we walk down the street, everyone turns to look at him!\n— Who needs your donkey when I’ve got a leather saddle, not that rag of yours!\n— Well, my bridle has a tag engraved with the master’s name! That’s a mark of the highest quality!\nAbu Bakr and Ibn Arabi exchanged glances. The warrior’s eyes betrayed undisguised astonishment, while the Sufi merely shook his head.\n— Even in distant lands, fools find something to argue about, — Ibn Arabi muttered.\n— This isn’t an argument; it’s a disease, — Abu Bakr chuckled. — Like two rich men boasting about chariots, except all they’ve got are donkeys.\n— Should we tell them they both look ridiculous?\n— Nah, let them live in their delusion. It’s more entertaining.\nThey sidestepped the bickering pair, casting them final mocking glances, and plunged into the noisy bazaar, where merchants were already spreading out a world of wondrous goods before them."
