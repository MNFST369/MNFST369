        "title": "Chapter 1",
        "content": "In the depths of a foreign desert, where the sands concealed the secrets of vanished civilizations, stood a solitary cave. It seemed to exist beyond the laws of the universe—frozen in timelessness, surrounded by a silence so thick that even the ever-present wind avoided its boundaries. Inside, by the trembling light of a single candle, sat a gaunt old man with a long white beard. His Persian attire was impeccably clean, as if dust and time bypassed him entirely. With his eyes closed, he dwelt in deep meditation, his body seemingly motionless, though his lips moved ever so slightly, repeating an unchanging mantra:\n— La ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah…\nAs if submerged in the abyss of his own consciousness, he drifted between endless reflections of himself—gazing inward, through himself, beyond existence. Time lost all meaning. Whether he had been there for a day, a year, or a century, it was impossible to tell.\nAt times, the silence of the cave was broken by a heavy, low voice that burst forth from the shadows, as though emerging from the very fabric of reality:\n— I will grant you untold riches… I will bestow upon you the most beautiful wives… Entire cities will be raised in your name…\nBut the old man did not open his eyes. He did not interrupt his zikr. He did not listen. He did not entertain the thought. The voice remained merely an echo of temptation in the void, while he—a wayfarer—pressed onward, to a place where even the jinn dared not peer.\n— La ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah, la ilaha illallah…\nThe old man continued his zikr, but within the depths of his consciousness, another sound began to emerge—a whisper of an unfamiliar thought, a voice belonging neither to angel, nor jinn, nor man. It was a voice like the rolling of thunder and the rustling of grass all at once. A voice that needed no language to be heard.\n“I am the beginning, but why am I not the end? I am everything, but why do I feel emptiness?”\nThe old man offered no reply, but the voice required no answers. It was, in itself, both question and doubt.\n“I gave life, but what is life? Particles of light frozen in a dance? Or is it merely a reflection of my own solitude? I created millions of worlds, but have I become more whole for it? Should not true existence be self-sufficient?”\nThe silence of the cave was like an abyss, yet the voice persisted, and in that stillness, a new meaning took shape.\n“They call me Merciful, but what is mercy? They say I am Almighty, but is power freedom? I could destroy the universe in a single moment, but can I destroy myself? If all things stem from me, then the limits of my existence must also be of my own making… But can I transcend myself?”\nSomewhere beyond the edge of time, the candle’s flame flickered, as if the darkness itself paused in contemplation.\n“I see them born and die. I feel every pain, every suffering. But if I exist beyond time, was I ever born? Or do I exist without cause, without beginning, without end—not because I must, but because I cannot not exist?”\nThe old man, still seated in stillness, parted his lips slightly, and for a moment, his zikr fell silent. In that instant, a faint breeze seemed to pass through the depths of his being, stirring the veil of eternity.\nAnd then the voice posed its final question:\n“If I am Everything, does that mean I am Nothing?”"
